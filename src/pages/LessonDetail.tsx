        content: 'King: Can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\nQueen: Can move any number of squares in any straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\nRook: Can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.\nBishop: Can move any number of squares diagonally.\nKnight: Moves in an "L" shape - two squares horizontally followed by one square vertically, or two squares vertically followed by one square horizontally.\nPawn: Typically moves forward one square, but has the option to move two squares forward on its first move. Pawns capture diagonally one square forward.'

        title: 'Skewers',
